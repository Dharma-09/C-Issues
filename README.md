<h1 align=center><code>c4-common-issues</code></h1>

This repository aims to provide a list of issues found regularly in [Code4Rena](https://code4rena.com/)
contests.

## Introduction

Code4Rena runs community-driven contests for smart contract audits in which
wardens search for issues and judges allocate awards to wardens based on performance.

A problem currently in the community is how to handle commonly found issues
as they increase the judge's workload.

This repo aims to identify common issues and provide background information.

The goal is, that wardens include the issue's identifier in a contest submission.

This would help judges mark the issues as duplicates and hopefully decrease
their workload.
